# Text Analysis App - Async/Await & LINQ Demo

A comprehensive C# console application that demonstrates the power of **async/await** patterns and **LINQ** operations through text analysis functionality.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project showcases two fundamental C# features:
- **Async/Await**: Asynchronous programming for non-blocking file operations
- **LINQ**: Language Integrated Query for powerful data manipulation and analysis

## 🚀 Features

### Async/Await Demonstrations
- ✅ Asynchronous file reading with `File.ReadAllTextAsync()`
- ✅ Asynchronous file writing with `File.WriteAllTextAsync()`
- ✅ Task composition and chaining
- ✅ Proper exception handling in async methods
- ✅ Simulated async processing with `Task.Delay()`

### LINQ Operations Showcased
- ✅ **Filtering**: `.Where()` for data selection
- ✅ **Projection**: `.Select()` for data transformation
- ✅ **Grouping**: `.GroupBy()` for data aggregation
- ✅ **Ordering**: `.OrderBy()` and `.OrderByDescending()`
- ✅ **Aggregation**: `.Count()`, `.Average()`, `.Min()`, `.Max()`
- ✅ **Set Operations**: `.Distinct()` for unique values
- ✅ **Complex Queries**: Chained operations for sophisticated analysis

## 📊 Analysis Features

The application performs comprehensive text analysis including:

1. **Basic Statistics**
   - Total word count
   - Unique word count
   - Average word length
   - Shortest and longest words

2. **Word Frequency Analysis**
   - Top 10 most frequent words
   - Word occurrence counting

3. **Word Length Distribution**
   - Visual bar chart of word lengths
   - Length-based grouping

4. **Linguistic Analysis**
   - Words starting with vowels vs consonants
   - Sentence statistics
   - Repeated word detection with positions

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Framework**: .NET 9.0
- **Language**: C# 12
- **Features Used**:
  - Async/Await patterns
  - LINQ operations
  - String manipulation
  - File I/O operations
  - Exception handling

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run

### Prerequisites
- .NET 9.0 SDK or later
- Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd text-analysis-app
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

3. The application will:
   - Create a sample `input.txt` file if it doesn't exist
   - Analyze the text asynchronously
   - Generate detailed results in `output.txt`
   - Display results in the console

## 📖 Code Explanation

### Async/Await Implementation

```csharp
// Async file operations
string text = await File.ReadAllTextAsync(inputFile);
await File.WriteAllTextAsync(outputFile, results);

// Async method composition
public static async Task AnalyzeTextAsync(string inputFile, string outputFile)
{
    var results = await PerformComplexAnalysisAsync(text);
    // More async operations...
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Non-blocking I/O operations
- Better resource utilization
- Improved application responsiveness
- Proper exception propagation

### LINQ Operations Examples

```csharp
// Complex LINQ query for word frequency
var topWords = words
    .GroupBy(word => word)                    // Group identical words
    .Select(group => new { 
        Word = group.Key, 
        Count = group.Count() 
    })                                        // Project to anonymous type
    .OrderByDescending(x => x.Count)         // Sort by frequency
    .Take(10)                                // Get top 10
    .ToList();                               // Execute query

// Word length distribution
var lengthDistribution = words
    .GroupBy(word => word.Length)            // Group by length
    .Select(group => new { 
        Length = group.Key, 
        Count = group.Count() 
    })
    .OrderBy(x => x.Length)                  // Sort by length
    .ToList();

// Advanced filtering and projection
var duplicateWords = words
    .Select((word, index) => new { Word = word, Index = index })
    .GroupBy(x => x.Word)
    .Where(group => group.Count() > 1)       // Only duplicates
    .Select(group => new { 
        Word = group.Key, 
        Count = group.Count(),
        Positions = group.Select(x => x.Index).ToList()
    })
    .OrderByDescending(x => x.Count)
    .Take(5)
    .ToList();
```
